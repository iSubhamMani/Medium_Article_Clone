                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>You may have heard a joke that the <strong>Internet is a series of tubes.</strong>
                    In this blog post, we’re going to talk about how we get a cool, 
                    refreshing stream of 
                    Airbnb.com bytes into your browser as quickly as 
                    possible using <strong>HTTP Streaming.</strong>
                    <p>
                        Let’s first understand what streaming means. Imagine we had a spigot and two options:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Fill a big cup, and then pour it all down the tube (the “buffered” strategy)</li>
                            <li>Connect the spigot directly to the tube (the “streaming” strategy)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </p>
        
                <h1>Implementing Streaming at Airbnb</h1>
                <p>
                    Streaming has clear advantages, but most websites today still rely on a buffered approach to 
                    generate responses. One reason for this is the additional engineering effort required 
                    to break the page into independent chunks. This just isn’t feasible sometimes.
                    For example, if all of the content on the page relies on a <i>backend query</i> , then we won’t be able to send anything until that query finishes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, there’s one use case that’s universally applicable. 
                    We can use streaming to reduce network waterfalls. This term refers to when one network request triggers another, resulting in a cascading series of sequential requests. 
                    This is easily visualized in a tool like Chrome’s Waterfall:
                </p>
                <div class="post-image-2">
                    <img src="./images/chrome-waterfall.jpg" alt="Chrome Waterfall">
                </div>
                <p class="waterfall-img-description">Chrome Network Waterfall illustrating a cascade of sequential requests</p>
                <p>
                    Most web pages rely on external JavaScript and CSS files linked within the HTML, resulting in a network waterfall — downloading the HTML triggers JavaScript and CSS downloads. As a result, 
                    it’s a best practice to place all CSS and JavaScript tags near the beginning of the HTML in the <head> tag. This ensures that the browser sees them earlier. 
                    With streaming, we can reduce this delay further, by sending that portion of the <head> tag first.
