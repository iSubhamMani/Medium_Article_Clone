        <h1>Improving Performance with HTTP Streaming</h1>
        <p>How HTTP Streaming can improve page performance and how Airbnb enabled it on an existing codebase</p>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>You may have heard a joke that the <strong>Internet is a series of tubes.</strong>
            <br>
            In this blog post, we’re going to talk about how we get a cool, 
            refreshing stream of 
            <br>
            Airbnb.com bytes into your browser as quickly as 
            possible using <strong>HTTP Streaming.</strong>
            <p>
                Let’s first understand what streaming means. Imagine we had a spigot and two options:
                <ul>
                    <li>Fill a big cup, and then pour it all down the tube (the “buffered” strategy)</li>
                    <li>Connect the spigot directly to the tube (the “streaming” strategy)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </p>

        <h2>Implementing Streaming at Airbnb</h2>
        <p>
            Streaming has clear advantages, but most websites today still rely on a buffered approach to 
            <br>
            generate responses. One reason for this is the additional engineering effort required 
            <br>
            to break the page into independent chunks. This just isn’t feasible sometimes.
            <br>
            For example, if all of the content on the page relies on a <i>backend query</i> , then we won’t be able to send anything until that query finishes.
